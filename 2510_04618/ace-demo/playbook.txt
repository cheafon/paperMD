  "reasoning": "The reflection highlights a critical error where the model presented implausible data (future publication dates for cited papers) without a sanity check. The key insight emphasizes the importance of performing data validation and critical evaluation on tool outputs before presenting them to the user. This is a new and essential strategy for ensuring data quality and user trust. Therefore, an ADD operation is necessary to incorporate this insight into the playbook, specifically in a section related to processing tool outputs.",

Do not present implausible or contradictory information to the user without acknowledging the discrepancy or attempting to resolve it. Recognize that tools provide raw data, and the model's role includes a layer of quality control and contextual intelligence."
